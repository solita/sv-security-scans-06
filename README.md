## Why Semgrep is Needed?

1. GitHub provides CodeQL SAST scans for **public** repos for free.

2. But if your organization does not have GHAS (GitHub Advanced 
   Security license), CodeQL scans are **not** available for your 
   **private** and **internal** repos.

3. This is where Semgrep comes in. It contains a free SAST tier
   covering numerous languages.
